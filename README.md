🧠 Brain Tumor Classification using CNN & Transfer Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on automatic brain tumor classification from MRI images using Deep Learning.
Both a Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Transfer Learning model (EfficientNetB0) are implemented, evaluated, and compared.
A Streamlit web application is developed to allow users to upload MRI images and receive real-time predictions with confidence scores.

🎯 Objectives

Classify brain MRI images into four tumor categories:

Glioma

Meningioma

No Tumor

Pituitary

Build and train:

A Custom CNN

A Transfer Learning model (EfficientNetB0)

Evaluate models using standard performance metrics

Deploy the best-performing model using Streamlit
